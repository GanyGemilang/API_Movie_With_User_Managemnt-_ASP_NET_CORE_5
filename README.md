# API_Movie_With_User_Managemnt_ASP_NET_CORE_5

In this project, we used the C# programming language with ASP.NET Core 5 framework to develop a microservices system that includes two main services: the Movie Service and the User Service. The Movie Service is responsible for managing movie data, while the User Service handles user management. Both of these services communicate with each other through the HTTP protocol and use data exchange formats such as JSON. These two services are interconnected using a Gateway service that was created concurrently with the Movie and User Services. The database used in this project is SQL Server.
